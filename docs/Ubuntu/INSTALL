3) Introduction
---------------
EasySCP delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With EasySCP you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of EasySCP are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. EasySCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) Installation
---------------

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /usr/src
	# sudo tar xfvz easyscp-1.2.0.tar.gz
	or when you load Bzip2 Archive
	# sudo tar xjvf easyscp-1.2.0.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./easyscp-1.2.0

3. Install the required packages

	First update your system:
	# sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

	Install all required packages:

	# sudo apt-get install $(cat ./docs/ubuntu-packages-precise)

	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site'. 'mail name' should
        be the server's domain. If you've set debian up correctly on install your
        domain should be already shown. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(if you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. (optional) Check the easyscp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Start the basic setup:
	# ./easyscp-setup.sh

	Setup will now Build the Software and copy all the directories into your system.
	After that, Setup will then secure your MySQL installation.
	Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	Last it will ask you to start to set up the frontend.

	If no error occour select yes and install EasySCP step-by-step.

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at http://www.easyscp.net to solve the problem.
